[00:05.32] Snowflake, I catch you tonight
[00:12.53] Catch you and keep you on ice, my love
[00:19.68] Snowflake, you know you're the only one
[00:25.43] There's no one like you, so I'm gonna hide you, my sweet
[00:32.30] Keep you to winter when you won't be needing me
[00:55.80] 
[00:41.42] Snowflake, I'm tryin' to keep you safe
[00:48.23] You gave me your trust, and I want you safe
[00:55.58] Snowflake, you know I have got your back
[01:01.17] There's no one like you, so I'm gonna hide you, my sweet
[01:08.26] Keep you to winter when you won't be needing me
[01:31.76] 
[01:15.49] Christmas day, your freedom comes
[01:22.63] Unprotected from the sun
[01:29.67] By then, you'll be cold, and now
[01:36.46] For me to send you off with love
[01:52.46] 
[01:42.35] Snowflake, don't forget us
[01:49.63] Snowflake don't forget us
[01:56.65] Snowflake don't forget us
[02:02.14] If I were a betting man, I'd bet a million on you
[02:08.80] There's no way around this, the only way now is through
[02:36.30] 
[02:16.26] Snowflake, now you're on your own
[02:23.18] I love you, I know you're just here alone
[02:30.61] You blessed us, and soon, you'll be on your way
[02:36.08] There's no one like you, so I'll cry myself here to sleep
[02:42.95] I kept you to winter, now you won't be needing me
[03:07.45] 
[02:50.41] Christmas day, your freedom comes
[02:57.53] Unprotected from the sun
[03:04.51] By then you'll be cold, and now
[03:11.57] For me to send you off with love
[03:27.57] 
[03:17.19] Snowflake don't forget us
[03:24.29] Snowflake don't forget us
[03:31.59] Snowflake don't forget us
[03:36.82] If I were a betting man, I'd bet a million on you
[03:43.63] There's no way around this, the only way now is through
