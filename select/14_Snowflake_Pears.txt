Exhume the dead decathlon
We're running races on all fours
I am a snowflake to satiate the yearning
To whet the tongues of thirsty ne'er-do-wells
Appease the peasant
In the quarters of the puppeteers
A child that can't wipe its own ass
But knows enough to feel ashamed
I'm stretched as thin as a fishing line
In a vessel stuck in neutral on an infinite decline

Yeah, oh what a privilege to remain submerged
Compassion's only real when it hurts
Drag your fingers 'tween my lips, please teach me how
Live in an unearned home in my heart
My love undone, I am the one celestial cockroach

Ask and receive
Hear and discard
Gather your toys
Play in the yard

Stray from our sight and immediately the
Memory's gone, discover what we do is secret

Frail, the connection, disciple and messiah
The strings that lift my fingers to the sky
Unclear discernment
Am I god or another stock marionette
Built to believe he is unique?

Stray from our sight and immediately the
Memory's gone, discover what we do is secret

Hush darling
